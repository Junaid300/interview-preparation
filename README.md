### What is OOP?
##### OOP is a real-world problem solver technique or paradigm which relies on the concept of class and object. It helps to achieve
1. Provide Reusability
1. Provide Security
1. Help to solve Complex Problems

### Why use OOPs?
1. OOP allow us to share the data between different class.
2. OOP help us to divide the bigger problem into smaller and it can reduce the complexity of problem.
3. We can secure the information using abstraction and encapsulation

### What are the main features of OOPs?
1. Inheritence : Provide us reusablity and allow to share the data members and methods from parent  to derive classes. Dervice classes that are inherited from parent classes can access data members and method of paraent class.
2. Polymorphis : Many methods can do task in different ways
3. Abstract : Hide unnessary information and show only relevant information.
4. Encapsulation : Wrapping data members and method in a class. And expose only select information to outer world


### What is class?
##### Class is Non-primitive named ground of property and function. Class is blue print of object so it is logical construct.

### What is object?
##### Object is the instace of class. Instance means physical existance.

### Primitive vs Non-Primitive  data types
1. Primitive : Primitive data types are those which store kind of data types.(int, boolean , string , array)
2. Non-Primitive : Primitive  are those which are user defined and can store differnt type of data types. (classes)


### Polymorphism
##### Polymorphism mean many form. An object or methods or varible can have many form. Polymorpsim is based on methods.

### Over Loading
##### When two or more methods same method name and type but have different  of parameters - Static or compile Time
### Over Writing
### Over Riding
##### When two or more methods have same name and paramenters but one in parent class and other in child class. - DyNamic or Run Time
### Virtual Function
##### Virtual Function is member fuction that you can expected that function will redefine in derive class of base class.
### Pure Virtual Function
